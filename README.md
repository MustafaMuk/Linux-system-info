# Linux System Information Script

## Overview
This **Linux System Information** script collects and displays key system metrics such as uptime, CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space. It also logs this information into timestamped files and archives them for easy reference.

## Features
- Displays real-time system information.
- Logs system information to a file.
- Archives logs for historical tracking.
- Helps with basic system monitoring and debugging.
- Runs the uptime, top, free, and df commands.

## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based system (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.
- `bash` shell installed (default on most Linux distributions).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:MustafaMuk/linux-system-info.git
   cd linux-system-info
   ```

2. Grant execute permissions to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x system_info.sh
   ```

## Usage
To execute the script and display system information:
```bash
./system_info.sh
```
If you encounter permission issues, try running it with `sudo`:
```bash
sudo ./system_info.sh
```
